# Nvim Setup

1. Watch Typecraft playlist and document with relevant UP TO DATE scripts to replicate.

Figure out how to automate, for both root and user, the environments of NVIM, TMUX and I3
Setup Ideal:

NVIM -> LSP, Debugger, Neotree, comment, cattpuccini theme, telescope, fzf and grep search, 

ADD RELATIVE LINE NUMBERS :set rnu    " toggle relative numbering on

FZF -> ft command aka fzf that searches for /personal/ and /work/ only, and then opens tmux sesh
i3 alt 1 2 3 4 5 6 workplaces
Tmux customization themes and some plugins. 

NVIM -> add everything and if i can some ai agent stuff a la cursor in Nvim would be the best thing

batcat -> alias to cat

git aliases -> gc -> git add 

customize the terminal -> transparency, fonts, and more.  this would be tmux configs i think

OBsidian + Windsurf for vibe coding and higher level stuff, but obsidian files can be modified from nvim directly. And just use obsidian for the relationship stuff if needed, see how it goes. 

Automate all of this setup, PLUS pentesting, and more tools for the usual tinkering, and more. Use it and actively learn!
